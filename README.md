# EvaExchange Demo

To run the program you must follow these steps:

- Create a **Postgresql** database first.
- Edit **application.properties** file which is at /src/main/resources. Enter dbname, username and password
- Run command **'mvn spring-boot:run'**

Table creations for database are automatic, you can see the .sql file at /src/main/resources/schema.sql
